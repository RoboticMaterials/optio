Optio is served via nginx and gunicorn/flask. Both services start at bootup, check their status and output using

sudo systemctl status optio-rest-api.service
sudo systemctl status nginx.service

Runinng Optio on "localhost"
----------------------------

Run "npm start" in the main optio directory. Then switch to "optio/rest_api" and run "python3 server.py". When running on localhost (or 10.42.0.1), 
Optio does not use https. 


Creating a production build
---------------------------

Run "npm run-script build" in the main optio directory. Nginx will serve files from the "optio/build" directory and proxy requests to the gunicorn server.
